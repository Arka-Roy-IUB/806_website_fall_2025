    "text": "I’m the Web-Slinger, the Wall-Crawler, and your friendly neighborhood hero. By day, I’m a down-on-my-luck scientist perpetually juggling deadlines and debt. But a freak accident gave me incredible powers, and the loss of a loved one taught me that “with great power comes great responsibility”. Now, I use my scientific mind and arachnid abilities to protect the innocent and crack a few jokes along the way. Balancing the two sides of my life is a constant, messy struggle, but it’s a sacrifice I’ll always make.\nMy life isn’t easy; I struggle with bills and things often don’t go my way. But I’ve learned that you can’t let your struggles stop you from doing the right thing. It’s this everyman quality that allows me to connect with the city’s regular people as the masked hero they sometimes see swinging by.\n\n\n\nSaving innocent people\nNot dying of hunger\nMaintaining to have a roof over my head\n\n\n\n\n\nLifelong learner but currently enrolled into Biochemistry PhD program\n\n\n\n\n\nDelivered Pizza during College\nCurrently working as a photographer in The Daily Bugle\nSaved New-York many times (Trust Me)\nPlease don’t forget to checkout my projects.\nThanks for checking out my web site!"

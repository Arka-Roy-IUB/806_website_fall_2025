:::{#me}

I'm the Web-Slinger, the Wall-Crawler, and your friendly neighborhood hero. By day, I'm a down-on-my-luck scientist perpetually juggling deadlines and debt. But a freak accident gave me incredible powers, and the loss of a loved one taught me that "with great power comes great responsibility". Now, I use my scientific mind and arachnid abilities to protect the innocent and crack a few jokes along the way. Balancing the two sides of my life is a constant, messy struggle, but it's a sacrifice I'll always make.

My life isn't easy; I struggle with bills and things often don't go my way. But I've learned that you can't let your struggles stop you from doing the right thing. Itâ€™s this everyman quality that allows me to connect with the city's regular people as the masked hero they sometimes see swinging by.

## Project 1
**Web-Shooter: Mk. IV (Ongoing Development)**

This project details the continuous research and development behind Spider-Man's iconic web-shooter technology.

* **Project Summary**: This is the fourth major iteration of the wearable, wrist-mounted web-fluid dispersal device. The focus of this version is on enhanced efficiency and increased versatility. Previous models had issues with fluid dispersal rates and user-interface limitations.

* **Outcome**: The project has resulted in a more reliable and eco-friendly web-shooter, proving its effectiveness in countless field tests across New York City.

## Project 2
**Enhanced Spider-Tracer Prototype**

This project documents the creation of a more advanced, discreet, and multi-functional tracking device for crime detection and asset recovery.

* **Project Summary**: The original tracers were effective but limited in range and features. This prototype adds new capabilities.

* **Outcome**: The enhanced tracer has been deployed successfully in several field missions, resulting in the recovery of stolen goods and the apprehension of criminal masterminds.


## Project 3
**Spider-Bot: Autonomous Surveillance & Rescue System**

This project outlines the development of a small, mobile, and intelligent robot designed to aid in search-and-rescue operations and reconnaissance.

* **Project Summary**: The Spider-Bot is an autonomous drone designed to navigate complex urban environments. It was created to provide a safer way to assess dangerous situations and assist in reaching individuals trapped in collapsed structures or inaccessible areas.
* **Outcome**: The Spider-Bot has been successfully tested in controlled simulations and has been deployed in several low-stakes situations, proving its potential as a valuable, non-lethal tool for urban defense.
